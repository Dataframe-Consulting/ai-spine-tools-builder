## Integration Patterns

### External API Integration
```typescript
// Pattern for resilient external API calls
const callExternalAPI = async (url, options, retries = 3) => {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= retries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(url, {
        ...options,
        timeout: 10000
      });
      
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`);
      }
      
      return await response.json();
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === retries) throw error;
      
      const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000; // Exponential backoff
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
    }
  }
};
```

### Database Integration
```typescript
// Pattern for database operations with connection pooling
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  max: 20,
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
});

execute: async ({ input }) => {
  const client = await pool.connect();
  try {
    await client.query('BEGIN');
    const result = await client.query('SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = $1', [input.id]);
    await client.query('COMMIT');
    return { data: result.rows };
  } catch (error) {
    await client.query('ROLLBACK');
    throw error;
  } finally {
    client.release();
  }
}
```

### Message Queue Integration
```typescript
// Pattern for message queue integration
import amqp from 'amqplib';

let connection;
let channel;

const initializeQueue = async () => {
  connection = await amqp.connect(process.env.RABBITMQ_URL);
  channel = await connection.createChannel();
  await channel.assertQueue('tasks', { durable: true });
};

execute: async ({ input }) => {
  if (!channel) await initializeQueue();
  
  const message = JSON.stringify(input);
  channel.sendToQueue('tasks', Buffer.from(message), { persistent: true });
  
  return { messageId: Date.now(), queued: true };
};
```
